>### Predicting the most cost-effective region of Puerto Rican unsubsidized rental properties
## Overview
* Government tax incentives such as Act 22, Act 60 have increased Puerto Rican expats to the island. This increase in tourism and permanent foreign residents has increased the unsubsized rent prices, however the minimum wage for most natives remains at $8.50 per hour. This dollar 25 cent increase only went into effect January 1, 2022. This incongruity imposes an obvious problem. Following the destruction of Hurricane Maria and Hurricane Irma in 2017, Act 60 was initiationed in 2019. This tax breaks was attractive to remote, tech and investory industries and was believed to be a reignition of the Puerto Rican economy but for natives of Puerto rico it meant that they could no longer afford to live in their country. 

## Project motivations
  * Puerto Rico is culturally significant to me which is why this topic was chosen. I intend on working with LATAM and Caribbean based organizations that this project will directly resonant. The topic I have chosen is relevant and pertinent in today's sociocultural climate especially now more than ever during the COVID-19 Pandemic. I will take the mechanisms that I learned through this data analysis course and implement them to optimize programs based on wellness, project manangment objectives and legislative tiers.
