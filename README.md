## Project motivations
  * Puerto Rico is culturally significant to me which is why this topic was chosen. I intend on working with LATAM and Caribbean based organizations that this project will directly resonant. The topic I have chosen is relevant and pertinent in today's sociocultural climate especially now more than ever during the COVID-19 Pandemic. I will take the mechanisms that I learned through this data analysis course and implement them to optimize programs based on wellness, project manangment objectives and legislative tiers.
